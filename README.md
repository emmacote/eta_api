# eta_api
by Emma Cote

This project exists specifically to act as a web api for usage by the eta_client project. A few things to note about this...

1. It does CRUD operations on a MySQL datastore.
2. It's more specific purpose is to create, retrieve, and modify a list of tasks to be done.
3. It is just a practice project for the author creating this project. Not intended for production use.
